# Fibonacci_Finder
An application that does its best to find Fib numbers. 

This program can get up to the 32 number in the sequence before it becomes inaccurate. 
I do use long long unsigned ints but,
I believe a different solution is needed to get farther along like some online programs seem capable of.
Math studies is my favorite.
